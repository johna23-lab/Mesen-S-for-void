## Development Builds

Development builds of the latest commit are available from Appveyor. For release builds, see the **Releases** tab on GitHub.

**Warning:** These are development builds and may be ***unstable***. Using them may also increase the chances of your settings being corrupted, or having issues when upgrading to the next official release. Additionally, these builds are currently not optimized via PGO and will typically run a bit slower than the official release builds.
